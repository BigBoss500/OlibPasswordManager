Olib Password Manager is free software that allows you to store passwords, notes, documents and other important personal data on your computer. Powered by Microsoft .NET Core 3.1 WPF.

## Why this project?
There are many different password managers. One is free, the other is paid, the third has the most functionality, and the fourth has less. **My goal of this project** is to combine the best of other managers and implement it together.

## Requirements
To run Olib Password Manager, **you must** have .NET Core version 3.1 and higher.

## Functional
With Olib Password Manager, you can store passwords on your computer **using AES encryption**.

## Where can I download preview versions?
To view the preliminary version and find out future functions, just go to the repository directory: _bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1_
> **Note.** Pre-builds can contain many errors, I have no responsibility for the builds.
