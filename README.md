## Why this project?
There are many different password managers. One is free, the other is paid, the third has the most functionality, and the fourth has less. **My goal of this project** is to combine the best of other managers and implement it together.

## Features:
* Tabs and interaction with multiple bases;
* Supports x86, x64 and ARM architectures;
* Localization support (6 languages supported):
   * English;
   * French;
   * German;
   * Russian;
   * Armenian;
   * Ukrainian.
* Cross-platform;
* Modern (built on the latest technology);
* Simple

#### Requirements:
* Almost all platforms ([see here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0-supported-os.md))
* .NET 5 Runtime (starting from 3.1.1 the application will become standalone and you will not have to install .NET 5 separately);

## Where can I watch previews?

> **Attention:** these releases may be unstable and may even damage your base. Use only if you know what you are doing. It is recommended to make a backup copy of the database.
